### Summary:
Switchy Shapes is a 2D mobile game built from scratch using the Unity Game Engine and C# scripting. It has been a great learning experience and I'm quite happy with the final product. All game programming, UI, UX, sound design, graphics, store management (and so on...) was done by myself.

### Code Samples:

* All code commenting and documentation is from the project's original files. I would have never been able to finish this project if I never documented my code.

* _<a href="https://github.com/h-cheema/SwitchyShapes-Overview/blob/master/LevelLocker.cs" target="_blank">LevelLocker.cs</a>_
	* Uses the player's current level to decide which levels are available to play.

* _<a href="https://github.com/h-cheema/SwitchyShapes-Overview/blob/master/LevelPreprocessor.cs" target="_blank">LevelPreprocessor.cs</a>_
	* Gathers the needed date to set up a level correctly. This includes things like the configuration of the shape columns, height gap between shapes, and the flow speed of the shapes.

* _<a href="https://github.com/h-cheema/SwitchyShapes-Overview/blob/master/LevelSpawner.cs" target="_blank">LevelSpawner.cs</a>_
	* Takes information from LevelPreprocessor.cs and spawns flowing shapes before the game starts.

### Development Process Overview
* Before I started planning, I made sure that this project was realistic and that I was capable of completing it. Once I confirmed that I moved on to turning my idea into reality.

* (Complete dev process coming soon.)
